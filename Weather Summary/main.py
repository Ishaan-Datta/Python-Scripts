# using numpy, pandas, sklearn
# use weather API to download/store historical weather data in CSV file
# should contain temperature, classification (cloudy, etc.), humidity and other numerical values
# use sklearn pretrained model: decisiontreeregressor?
# convert dates into long-number, temperature and convert weather type to number
# use dictionary classification to add weather type to number into pandas database
# input array of date, weathertype and number into model
# output array of temperature and weathertype
# What would you like to do? Look up weather on specific day, predict weather on specific day. save pretrained model instead of training in application? Test accuracy? -> year, month, day input
# tree_model.fit(x_train, y_train)
# 20% for test accuracy, 80% for training, check the ML content we learned earlier
# Pull weather information from a database
# Change its appearance based on the weather
# Use an attractive stylesheet to deliver hourly and weekly forecasts
# based on the user's location
# build a stand-alone script that pulls data from a free Weather API.
# turn it into a CSV or JSON for example.
# put spreadsheet data in a dataframe? -> Pandas
# use pandas data frame instead of manually inputting into arrays and APIs to pull them
# make a line graph of temperature each day. -> matplotlib
# maybe a couple of bar graphs or even a heat map.
# automated application, using Flask, pull the temperature every hour of every day.
# you can use it to update a live dashboard
