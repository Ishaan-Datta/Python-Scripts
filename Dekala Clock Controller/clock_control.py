# To control a Dekala Sunrise Alarm Clock over WiFi, you'll need to find out if the device provides any API or documentation for developers. If the device supports some form of API or network-based control, you can use Python to interact with it. Unfortunately, as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there isn't a widely known API for Dekala Sunrise Alarm Clock, and I don't have specific details about its capabilities.

# If the Dekala Sunrise Alarm Clock provides an API or has any form of network control, you would typically need to:

#     Read the Documentation:
#     Check the product documentation or contact the manufacturer to see if they provide any information about an API or network-based control.

#     Use Requests or a Similar Library:
#     If there's an API, you can use the requests library in Python to make HTTP requests and interact with the device.

# Here's a general template assuming you have an API:

# import requests

# # Replace these values with the actual API endpoints and parameters
# base_url = "http://your_alarm_clock_ip"
# api_path = "/api/your_endpoint"
# api_key = "your_api_key"

# # Example: Get the current scene
# response = requests.get(f"{base_url}{api_path}/get_scene", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"})
# print("Current Scene:", response.json())

# # Example: Set a new scene
# new_scene_data = {"scene": "morning"}
# response = requests.post(f"{base_url}{api_path}/set_scene", json=new_scene_data, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"})
# print("Set Scene Response:", response.json())

# Remember that this is a general template, and you need to replace the placeholder values with the actual API endpoints, paths, and authentication methods specified in the documentation.

#     Network Scanning:
#     If the device doesn't have a documented API, you might consider network scanning or packet sniffing to understand how the device communicates over the network. However, this can be more complex and is generally not recommended without explicit permission from the device manufacturer.

# Remember, controlling a device over the network may involve security considerations, and you should ensure that you have the right to access and control the device in the intended way.

# If you find specific details about the Dekala Sunrise Alarm Clock's API or network control, feel free to provide that information, and I can help you with a more tailored script.
